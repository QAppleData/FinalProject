# FinalProject
Final project for machine learning course

The dataset used for training models are uploaded as "loan_small.csv"

The original dataset (2.2GB) and the first subset named "loan_clean"(100MB) was unable to upload due to size limits.

The "Hold-Out" dataset was sample randomly out of "loan_clean", there could be a problem of overlapping with the training set. Although the chance of a single instance was sampled in both training set and testing set is very low, I believe it could still happen. I should've reserved this part of data before I started the project, but I didnt think that far ahead. But one way to make it up is to run a couple of these datasets to test the performance of the models.

The Neural Network model used all default parameters, I will tune it later when I have more time to imporve this project. But I think tuning parameter would not solve the overfitting issue.
